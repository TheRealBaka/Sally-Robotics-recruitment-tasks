# Sally-Robotics-recruitment-tasks
This repo contains the coding assignments done by Kshitij Kumar (2019A3PS0256P) from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course and Neural Networks and Deep Learning course.
Please refer to the ML branch to see my coding assignments of the Machine Learning course, whereas the master branch will consist of the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course coding assignments. 
Here's the link to the github repo from where I found the Python-equivalent assignments for the ML coding assignments:
